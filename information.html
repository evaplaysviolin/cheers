        <p class="bodyText">We will be married in a private ceremony on Wednesday, September 27th, 2017.</p>
        <p class="bodyText">The wedding reception will take place the following Saturday afternoon, 
          on September 30th, 2017, at the Lake Merced Boathouse in San Francisco. 
          The address is <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/fW94BD6WPvj" target="_blank">One Harding Road, San Francisco, CA 94132</a>.</p>
        <!--<p class="bodyText">Please check back later for an official start (and end) time to the reception!</p>-->

        <p class="bodyText subHeader">Questions</p>
        <p class="bodyText">Please click on the questions below to view the answers.</p>

        <p class="question bodyText">What time is the reception?</p>
          <p class="answer bodyText">The reception will begin at 12:00pm, and will end around 3:00pm.
        <p class="question bodyText">How do I get to the reception venue?</p>
          <p class="answer bodyText"><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/fW94BD6WPvj" target="_blank" id="infoLink">Click me for Google directions!</a><br>
          Please note that the actual boathouse is located a little further in than the specified address, and will be on the right-hand side
          as you drive through.</p>
        <p class="question bodyText">Will there be parking?</p>
          <p class="answer bodyText">Yes, and parking is free. Because Lake Merced is a public space, the parking lots will not be
            exclusive to the reception guests; there should still be plenty of spots to go around. There will be parking spaces along the road
            leading up to the boathouse as well as directly in front, and an "unofficial" dirt lot just past the building.</p>
        <p class="question bodyText">Is the boathouse wheelchair accessible?</p>
          <p class="answer bodyText">Yes. The parking lot, reception room, and the patio overlooking the lake are all on the same level.</p>
        <p class="question bodyText">Why are you only holding a reception, and not including the ceremony?</p>
          <p class="answer bodyText">We would like the ceremony to be a small affair, with only our immediate family members present.
            You won't be missing anything, we promise!</p>
        <p class="question bodyText">What attire is recommended?</p>
          <p class="answer bodyText">There is no official dress code. We (the bride and groom) will be leaning more towards the 
            formal end of the spectrum, but please feel free to dress casually and comfortably!</p>
        <p class="question bodyText">Will there be food?</p>
          <p class="answer bodyText">Yes! There will be a buffet-style lunch, with appetizers before and dessert after.</p>
        <p class="question bodyText">Will there be alcohol?</p>
          <p class="answer bodyText">There will be beer and wine available for those who wish to partake.</p>
        <p class="question bodyText">What are the accommodation options for out-of-town guests?</p>
          <p class="answer bodyText">We currently do not have a room block set up at any hotel. Lake Merced is located in the 
            southwest corner of the city, near Daly City. A suggestion would be to check out 
            <a href="https://www.airbnb.com" target="_blank">Airbnb</a>'s 
            in the area. Please feel free to reach out to us if you need any help finding a place to stay!</p>
