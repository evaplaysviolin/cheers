Wedding Reception Website

After going through Codecademy's courses on Javascript, HTML & CSS, and jQuery,
I thought I would cut my teeth on creating a functional site for my upcoming
wedding reception.

There is separate code for the back-end submit process (for the RSVP form)
excluded from this repository as I wasn't the one who wrote it, not having 
studied any server-side programming (yet).
